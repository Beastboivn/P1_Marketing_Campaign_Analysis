# P1_Marketing_Campaign_Analysis
## Project Background
After a busy year of running marketing campaigns, data of all the campaigns of company A in 2022 was gathered and sent to you, an experienced data analyst, to extract insights. The CEO wants the following questions answered:
1. What is the company's **profitability trend**?
2. Are there any **channels doing badly**?
3. Which companies do we need to **continue signing** contracts and which can we **stop collaborating**?
